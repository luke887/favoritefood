You can't mess with New Yorkers and their pizza. Just try to convince one that chain store pizzas are as good as authentic city-style pie. If you've ever had the pleasure of enjoying a slice, you know what all the fuss is about. For those who haven't tried it, New York-style pizza is known for its thin crust and crispy texture, topped with authentic tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and toppings of choice. True pizza lovers fold the triangular wedges in half and scarf them down. Hot out of the oven, NYC pizza joints serve up super-sized slices that the hungry just can't get enough of. <p>
